# AGAPE

AGAPE (computational G-quadruplex Affinity Prediction) is a novel machine learning (ML)-based tool designed to predict the binding and stabilizing potential of small molecules targeting G-quadruplexes (G4s). 

Among the trained ML models, XGBoost achieved the best performance with an accuracy of nearly 91%, using 489 selected features. 
SHAP analysis highlighted descriptors related to molecular topology, polarizability, and electrostatic potential as key contributors to the classification.
