# AGAPE

AGAPE (computational G-quadruplex Affinity Prediction) is a novel machine learning (ML)-based tool designed to predict the binding and stabilizing potential of small molecules targeting G-quadruplexes (G4s). 

## XGBoost
Different machine learning algorithms were used, like Mutual Information, ANOVA, Chi-square, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and XGBoost but XGBoost was the most effective, achieving an accuracy of 91% using 489 features.

## SHAP Analysis
SHAP analysis highlighted descriptors related to molecular topology, polarizability, and electrostatic potential as key contributors to the classification. 
Specifically, a violin plot was used to show the top ten most relevant features.
